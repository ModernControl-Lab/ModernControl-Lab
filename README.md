- 👋 Hi, this is Modern Control Laboratory in Chung Yuan Christian University from Taiwan.
- 👀 Our lab is doing research on position and attitude control for drones using special orthogonal group SO(3) attitude representation.
- 🌱 We're currently learning how to adopt the PX4 code to work in the SO(3) framework. Our focus is on understanding and implementing the necessary modifications to enable SO(3) based control designs for our quadrotor. By leveraging the principles of SO(3) and our control algorithms, we aim to enhance the performance and stability of quadrotor's attitude and position control. We are excited about the challenges this presents and the potential advancements it can bring to the field of drone technology.
- 💞️ We're looking for partners to collaborate on developing simulation environments for testing and implementing quadcopter control algorithms under the SO(3) framework.
- 📫 You can contact us at jenteyu@hotmail.com. We are open to receiving emails and would be happy to connect with you.
