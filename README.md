- 👋 Hi, this is Modern Control Laboratory in Chung Yuan Christian University from Taiwan.
- 👀 We're interested in position and attitude control for quadrotor based on special orthogonal group SO(3).
- 🌱 We're currently learning how to adapt the PX4 code to work in the SO(3) framework. Our focus is on understanding and implementing the necessary modifications to enable SO(3) based control for our quadrotor. By leveraging the principles of SO(3) and its associated algorithms, we aim to enhance the performance and stability of our quadrotor's attitude and position control. We are excited about the challenges this presents and the potential advancements it can bring to the field of quadrotor technology.
- 💞️ We're looking for partners to collaborate on developing simulation environments for testing and evaluating quadcopter control algorithms under the SO(3) framework.
- 📫 You can contact us at prof.yucycu@gmail.com. I'm open to receiving emails and would be happy to connect with you.
